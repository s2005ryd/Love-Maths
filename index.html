<!-- So that we have a total of four buttons. And then just change the color classes.
So our second button then will be  blue, our third one will be orange,
and our fourth one is red. Then we need to  add the Font Awesome icon inside the buttons
and you can get the reference for these  icons from the Font Awesome website.
So I'm going to use the i element and give it  that class of fas which is the Font Awesome
base class, and then fa plus for a plus sign.  Again, we'll copy that and paste it three times.
And then just change the class for the different  signs, so minus... Then times, and finally divide.-->

<!-- We're going to add a custom  attribute called data type.
Now HTML allows us to add any attribute  we want. But if we do create our own
attributes it should have the prefix of data to  differentiate it from the default attributes.
Our new data attribute will hold the name  of the game that we're going to play.
We're going to use the content  of this attribute both as a label
and in the JavaScript for the game itself. So  let's add one to each button now.
Starting with our addition button then, we're going to add data-type, equals and then addition in quotes.
I'm just going to copy this, paste it into the next  button and I'm going to change that to subtract.
For our third button, it will be multiply.
And for our final button here, division.-->
            <button data-type="addition" class="btn btn--big btn--green">              
                <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>
            </button>
            <button data-type="subtract" class="btn btn--big btn--blue">
                <i class="fas fa-minus"></i>
            </button>
            <button data-type="multiply" class="btn btn--big btn--orange">
                <i class="fas fa-times"></i>
            </button>
            <button data-type="division" class="btn btn--big btn--red">
                <i class="fas fa-divide"></i>
            </button>
        </div>
<!--let's check our wireframe and we see  that we now need a question area.
So inside the question area we're going to display  our numbers, our operands, the sign or operator,
and the equal sign in spans. Let's go  ahead and create our question area div,
so div class = question area.
And again, inside here we're  going to create four spans.
So right now I'm just going to create them completely empty and then we'll add content to them in a minute.
The first span then, will  be for our first number, our first operand.
So we'll give that the ID of operand one, and  I'll put zero as some placeholder text here.
The second span is going to  contain our sign or operator.
So we'll give that the ID of operator  and I'll put the placeholder text of just an x.
Then an ID of operand 2 for  our second number, and a placeholder of zero.
And finally, the equals sign  which doesn't require an ID
because we're not going to  reference that from JavaScript.
I'm also going to create a paragraph here that  will only be visible on mobile, we'll style that with our CSS.
I'm going to give it the class of answer message, and just a text of enter answer.-->
    <div class="question-area">
        <span id="operand1">0</span>
        <span id="operator">x</span>
        <span id="operand2">0</span>
        <span>=</span>
        <p class="answer-message">Enter Answer:</p>
<!--So we're nearly complete now all we need is an  input field so that our user can type in the answer, and a button.
So we'll create our input field in the question area I'm going to give it the ID of answer box.
And the type of number so  that only numbers can be inputted into this input.
And finally, underneath the  div we're going to supply a button
so that we can submit our answers. So again,  we'll use the button element. We'll give it the
base class of btn this time it's going to be btn  grey. And we'll give it the text of submit answer.-->
        <input id="answer-box" type="number">
    </div>
        <button data-type="submit" class="btn btn--grey">Submit Answer</button>
    </div>



    <div class="score-area">
        <p class="scores">Correct Answers <span id="score">0</span></p>
        <p class="scores">Incorrect Answers <span id="incorrect">0</span></p>

    </div>
